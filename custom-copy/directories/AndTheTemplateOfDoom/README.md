## Instructions

If you are using [BusinessMuumuu](https://github.com/SuitAndCape/BusinessMuumuu), the `gitit` command is included in `.aliases`.  Run this command in a new directory to generate a repository scaffold.

The default skeleton files are:

- A `README.md` file for documentation
- An extensive `.gitignore` file
- An `.editorconfig` file
- An MIT `LICENSE`
- A `humans.txt` file for crediting contributors
- A `robots.txt` file for giving site instructions to web robots

### Modifying Templates
View the `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `robots.txt`, and `humans.txt` files.  These will be the skeleton files that make up your git and GitHub scaffolds.

Remove the files you don't plan on ever using, add files you frequently require, replace files with ones that are more relevant, and modify the remaining files to create your own personal scaffold.

#### robots.txt Skeleton
The `robots.txt` file helps developers enforce _[The Robots Exclusion Protocol](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html)_.  This isn't a foolproof system, but it's a good practice to include and customize this file.  For more information, check out [robotstxt.org](http://robotstxt.org/).

#### humans.txt Skeleton
The `humans.txt` file is part of the [humanstxt.org](http://humanstxt.org/) initiative, aiming to put the spotlight on the main authors and contributors of websites, apps, and projects.  It contains details like titles, roles, technologies, and links.

#### LICENSE Skeleton
The `LICENSE` file is your project's MIT License.  Include your ownership information.

#### README Skeleton
The `README.md` file is your project's documentation file.  Write a clear and informative `README.md` file so that people will know how they are supposed to use the project.

Be sure to properly modify all links below to fit your project and team.
