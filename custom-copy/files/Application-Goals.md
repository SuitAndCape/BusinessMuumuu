>### **_Coding is an art, and becoming a great artist takes time_**

## The Development Process

- Empathize with the user; the product is being developed for them
- Gather user stories and put together an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Pseudocoding helps determine which technologies are best suited for the project
- Think of the app in terms of general concepts, then turn it into classes and manipulatable code
- Designing a detailed UX workflow lays out a clear road map and reveals potential issues
- Draw an easily modifiable wireframes, optimized for use on various devices
- Deep dive into why the technologies do what they do
- Practice mobile-first design for scalability and a sleek, intuitive user experience
- Create an effective test-suite to run in parallel, during development
- Modularize code according to its primary function
- Build DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code to minimize the need for manual changes
- Initially, only add features that fulfill the application's purpose
- Solid Git workflow prevents disruption and loss of working and vital code
- Keep variable and method naming conventions consistent and descriptive
- Leave clear, concise comments to describe what each line of code is doing
- As an algorithm designer, adopt as your mantra the question: "Can We Do Better?"
- Proper indentations and line-breaks emphasize structure
- Documentation is important; write a solid README
- Every project, learn something new

## App Modeling Considerations

- What is it supposed to do?
- What kind of information does it need to know about?
- Will it be public or private (user accounts)?
- What kind of data do I need to keep?
- How are those different parts of data related to each other?

## The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Design Principle

- Develop the new application with sufficient features to satisfy the early adopters
- Each iteration focuses on developing a new feature, based on what the users want next

## The TED (Too Early to Design) design principle

- Delay as many decisions as possible, as long as you possibly can, when you're building software
- Keep a feature/concept out until you have time to think things through, and decided how you're going to implement it
  + Construct the application with clear hooks for the future feature/concept
- Building a bad feature/concept, committing broken code, or delaying the launch because an unnecessary component has an unresolved issue are major mistakes

## The Four P's of Problem Solving

1. **_Preparation_**
  - Understand and define a high level description of the problem and solution
2. **_Plan_**
  - Plan out the solution by breaking it down into little steps, and tackling one step at a time
    + Start with "why I'm doing it," then move onto "what I'm doing" and "how I'm doing it"
3. **_Perform_**
  - Perform what's required in your proposed solution
4. **_Perfect_**
  - Perfect your solution, by incrementally improving the project
